# Obftools

A multi-purpose gradle plugin to work with obfuscated codebases,
I recommend to fork this plugin as it contains a few hardcoded
stuff (especially in the remapper) though otherwise it is
useable for pretty much everywhere as long as the build system
is primitive enough. It will not work in more complicated envs
such as minecraft modding

Starloader-API probably might be an usage example for you,
if you dare to use it
