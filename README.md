# Method-remover

---

The most concerning gradle plugin you will ever see.
Seriously, don't use it unless you absolutely must.
It just removes methods that are annotated by a specific annotation,
and that is all the documentation you will ever get.

Starloader-API probably might be an example for you,
but chances are I changed it by now.
